# First_Token
This is the first token I made using Solidity. Its a simple representation of how contracting works and how minting and burning works.
# Description
Solidity, a programming language widely used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These include two functions that refersto the minting and burning of tokens on the network.
# Execution
To implement the program one needs an IDE which supports solidity, and then anyone can use the code to implement it up there. I have used an online platform named remix IDE.
